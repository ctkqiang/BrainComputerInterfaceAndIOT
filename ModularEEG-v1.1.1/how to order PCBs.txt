PCB's are ordered from Olimex, located in Bulgaria.

This file contains ordering information for v1.1.
It is the latest version sent to Olimex for manufacture.

Olimex charges for inital processing of the layouts. When a new revision of the ModularEEG is released, the price is $5 higher for the first person to order.

To order a set (1 analog + 1 digital) of PCBs, send an e-mail to Olimex <fastpcb@olimex.com> with the following info:

  Reference number: AR180903A
  Name:
  Email:
  Shipping address:
  Shipping option: Airmail

In return, you receive an e-mail with an order form in PDF format, which you should print, fill out, and fax back to them.

When the PCBs are shipped you will receive a notification e-mail. After that, delivery takes one to two weeks to most places.

Notes:

* If you already have a ModularEEG and want to add more channels, the Olimex reference number for a set of two analog boards is AR180903B.

* You will need a credit card (e.g VISA) so that they can charge you. Do *not* put the number in your e-mail. That is what the fax is for.

* You need to use a non-anonymous e-mail address, (i.e not Yahoo, Hotmail etc) because they have had trouble with credit card fraud.

See the Olimex web-site for shipping prices and other shipping options.
