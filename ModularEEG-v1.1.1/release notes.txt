Release Notes
-------------

To view the schematics and board layouts (.sch and .brd files),
download Eagle CAD from www.cadsoft.de
Eagle CAD runs on Linux as well as Windows.

Programming software and firmware info: see the ModularEEG zip-file.

Extras not included in the bill of materials:

* 34-pin ribbon cable (10-20cm of an old floppy-drive cable should work).
* Programming cable matching the 10-pin header on the ModularEEG. (see .zip file)
* Passthrough serial cable, and female DSUB connector.

* Battery connectors
* Battery

* Electrode connectors
* Electrodes
* Electrode cables
* Electrode paste and other accessories

* Optional: Enclosures.

It is recommended that you place the amplifier in a metal case, to reduce
electromagnetic interference.

You should NOT place the digital board in a metal case, because you can very
easily ruin the electrical isolation unless you know what you are doing.



Important postprocessing before making the modEEG pcbs


The modEEG pcbs are double sided with (plated through) vias and make heavy
use of "copper pouring".

Therefore the EAGLE *.brd files have to be postprocessed before printing in
the EAGLE CAD software with the "ratsnest" command.

Make sure Menu->options->set->misc->"Ratsnest processes polygones" is checked.

If the option is unchecked or no ratsnest is done, you do not get all the
important electrical connections that are implicitly done by the large so
called "copper pouring" polygons and the plated through vias - that are
electrical vertical connections from top to bottom layer.

Instead with "ratsnest" you get many thin yellow air-wires that indicate
missing connections between nodes (pins, pads) and would have to be soldered
manually if you should decide to use no copper pouring (what would be
absolutely no good idea!).

The openEEG developer teams decision to use double layer and copper pouring is
well founded, because it is essential for reduction of RF interference and
mains hum capacitively coupled into the circuit.

A modEEG built from pcbs without copper pouring after manual fixing all not
routed airwires (on both pcbs) will probably have sub optimal electrical
characteristics and performance (more noise and hum).


Change Log
----------
v1.1.1 - changes from v1.1.0
* Added postprocessing information to the release notes

v1.1.0 - changes from v1.0.0

* Replaced 10nF 5% capacitors with 1nF ceramic to increase AA-filter stability.
* Added placement markings for the 1uF caps on the amplifier board.
* Replaced Newark part number for 1MOhm resistors.
* Swapped top and bottom layers on the amplifier board.
* Added Newark part number for 22uH inductors.

* Added two mounting holes to the amplifier board
* Rewrote EEG connector labels
* Moved some connector labels into the silkscreen layer.
* Added Jake Stewart's cabling schematic
  (with edits - e.g text was too large in Eagle v4.09)


v1.0.0 - changes from v0.07:

* Changed to the standard versioning scheme: major.minor.bugfix
* Firmware is released separately from the schematics from now on.

* Changed D101 from BAT48 to 1N5818.

* Added a pin that makes it easier to connect the buffered common mode
  signals on different boards, to the single DRL amplifier.
  The pin is marked "COM" and is located near the DRL amplifier.
* Moved mounting screws on the analog board to opposite corners to
  increase the clearance around J201.
* Minor layout modifications on the boards, increasing the clearances
  around some capacitors.

* Clarified DRL trimming instructions on the schematic.
* Cleaned up the schematics some more.
* Cleaned up Cables.sch slightly.

v0.07 - changes from v0.06:

* Changed R124 and R128 (optocoupler LED-current limiters) to 470 ohms.
* Programming connector is now standard 10-pin.
* Cleaned up the digital board layout.
* 5VI 5VO power pins removed in favor of a single power input.
* Bugfix: digital board outline cut open to preserve isolation distances.
* Bugfix: Diode moved out from under 7805.
* 10k trimpots changed to 20k
* Added decoupling capacitor near optocoupler on isolated side.

v0.06 - changes from v0.05:

Important note:

Some parts from Newark did not fit the v0.04 / v0.05 PCBs so
the layout was modified for v0.06.

If you have a v0.05 board or earlier, the 1uF (both kinds), 10uF
and 47uF capacitors from Newark, may not fit on a v0.04 board.
The low-ESR 47uF capacitor may also be a tight fit.

The following three changes are what caused this:

* Layout change: Moved a few parts slightly to allow for bigger
  capacitors from Newark
* Layout change: Added holes (vias really) for 1uF capacitors with
  5mm lead pitch (from Newark).
* Layout change: Lead pitch for low ESR capacitor changed to 5 mm.

The other changes are:

* Added a "how to order PCBs.txt" file

* Change log bug. :o) These two changes were not mentioned in the
  previous change log entry:

  1 Added a "crowbar-diode" D104
    Only for those who will supply +5V from e.g a PS/2 port
    rather than using the on-board 7805.

  2 Added two 3mm mounting holes on each board.

* Modified the WARNING.txt file: Rewrote portions of the disclaimer
  for the ModularEEG, and split up some paragraphs to make them
  easier to read.
* Marked the programming-clock RC-network (C102, R108) as optional.
* Removed C102 from the order info spreadsheet.
* Remarked the crystal loading capacitors (C115, C116) as Cxtal.
* Fixed "missing junction" warnings in the schematics.

Complete BOM / order info overhaul:

* Added Newark Electronics (US) to the order info spreadsheet.
* Added partial Digi-Key (US) order info (to complement Newark)
* Modified inductor requirements: Increased Imax from 200mA to 285mA
  Actually ~200mA is ok, but is less than theoretical maximum.
* Added Cxtal calculation information.
* Reworked the notes.

v0.05 - changes from v0.04:

* Added missing 47uF capacitor in the BOM (you need 4, not 3)
* Added resistors missing in the BOM: R124 R125 R126 R127 R128 R129 R130 (all 1k)
* The v0.04 firmware read the ADC improperly, so no data was output.
* Change: New recommended ESR for C201 is 1 ohm.

  Recommended reference parts:

  Kemet T350K476K025AS or T356K476K025AS
  Digikey part no 399-1422-ND or 399-1347-ND
  47uF/25V, ESR = 1.0 ohm @ 100kHz.
  Lead pitch 5mm, price $5.07

  Note the 5mm lead pitch. The footprint on the PCB is not changed though.

v0.04 - changes from v0.03:

* Added a power-on LED.
* Removed secondary 7805. The DCDC converter is now required.
* Added a diode to protect the electronics from a reversed power supply.
* Added a 4th order lowpass filter, fc = 58Hz
* Switched to INA114 instrumentation amplifier.
* Gain changes: Second stage gain is 10 - 100, (G = 40 is the default).
  Filter gain is 16.
* Added 10k trimpot for subtracting common mode DC voltages in the DRL,
  caused by cheap inamps.

v0.03 - changes from v0.02

* New DC/DC converter footprint
* Fixed swapped component designators
* Bill of materials is rewritten.
* Added cabling schematics.
* Added new firmware source.
